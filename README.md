# NonToxic_Social_Media

## Description

A simple app mimicking a social media's setup, utilizing mongoDB/mongoose as a NoSQL backend. With it's limited structure meant for increased flexibility, RESTful API calling is still used to perform CRUD methods. This APP was created to get some experience manipulating a non-relational database. MongoJS' NoSQL roots allow for optimized efficiency at the expense of security, but is more mutable than standard mySQL databases which are harder to edit/change. Social media is known for it's varied and wide spread uses and so the less structured backend allows for more people to use the service for their own ends without fussing over "requirements" that mySQL might require.
